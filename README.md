# MKS-TFT
MKS-TFT Mod for Sidewinder X1 MK2

The original Makerbase firmware is not open source. This is only a mod of the compiled binary released for the Artillery Sidewinder X1.

The firmware has been modified in two ways:
- Bitmap and function customization
- Binary manipulation (hardcoded) to:
  - Modify the system font
  - Change menu titles
  - Call new bitmaps

Bitmaps derived from (and inspired by) Majurca's [MKS-TFT28-NEW-PICTURES](https://github.com/majurca/MKS-TFT28-NEW-PICTURES).
