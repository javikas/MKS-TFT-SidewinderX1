# MKS-TFT
MKS-TFT Mod for Sidewinder X1

The original Makerbase firmware is not open source. This is only a mod of the compiled binary released for the Artillery Sidewinder X1.

The firmware has been modified in two ways:
- Bitmap and function customization
- Binary manipulation (hardcoded) to:
  - Modify the system font
  - Change menu titles
  - Call new bitmaps

This custom firmware is intended to work with [MarlinSidewinderX1](https://github.com/javikas/MarlinSidewinderX1)
